With websites such as [GitHub][github] and [Bitbucket][bitbucket] opening up
the door to quickly creating and sharing open source projects, there has never
been a better time to make your way into the open source community.  There are
a few things you should know in order to get started working with open source
projects, which will be outlined in this post.

Finding a project to work on
----------------------------
There are tons of open source projects out there, the trick is finding a
project that interests you.  It is very likely that a program you use regularly
is open source, especially considering there are a lot of things being open
sourced recently.  The key to finding the open source project that suits you is
to find one that you are interested in, especially if it is something that you
regularly use.

For me, this was [Select2][select2], a project that provided a searchable
drop-down that could be connected to a remote API, something which I was going
to need in a project I was working on back in the summer of 2012.  Because the
project was focusing on tablets as the main point of interaction, there were a
few issues that I reported (and later fixed).  The project was added to my
watch list on GitHub and I eventually became a core committer to the project,
still maintaining it even now that I have moved away from it.

Some websites offer ways to find interesting open source repositories, such as
[GitHub's Explore][github-explore] which organizes popular repositories into
categories such as "Productivity tools" and "Data visualization".

Learning the code base
----------------------
If you are interested in helping out with an open source project, you should be
familiar with the code base and generally understand how things work.  This
 works best if you are actively using the code, or are planning on using it in
the near future on a project.

Communicating with the community
--------------------------------
There are usually three places for communication when working on software,
whether it is open source or closed source: the issue tracker, instant
messaging, and mailing lists.  While not all projects will have all three of
these communication channels, almost all projects will have an issue tracker
which is often used for feature requests and questions as well as reporting
issues.

### Issue trackers

GitHub and Bitbucket have their own, but others such as [Bugzilla][bugzilla]
exist.  Make sure to familiarize yourself with how issues are created and what
is supposed to go there.

### Instant messaging

[HipChat][hipchat], [IRC][irc], and other solutions.  The point is that you can
communicate with anyone who is online instantly.

### Mailing lists

Yup, just amazing email.  Whether self hosted or through
[Google Groups][google-groups], they are all really the same.  Read up on the
archives to see what is usually done there.

Fixing issues
-------------
As you use the software, you are almost guarenteed to find issues as you use
the code more and more.  Report the bug with a lot of useful information, ask
questions on IRC or mailing lists, get things done.
