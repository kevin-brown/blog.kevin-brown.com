With websites such as [GitHub][github] and [Bitbucket][bitbucket] opening up
the door to quickly creating and sharing open source projects, there has never
been a better time to make your way into the open source community.

Finding a project to work on
----------------------------
Find out if some piece of software you use and enjoy is already open source.
If nothing comes up, look for a project that is in an area of programming that
you love.

Learning the code
-----------------
If you are interested in helping out with an open source project, you should be
familiar with the code base and generally how things work.  This works best if
you are actively using the code, or are planning on using it.

Communicating with the community
--------------------------------
There are usually three places for communication when working on software,
whether it is open source or closed source: the issue tracker, instant
messaging, and mailing lists.  While not all projects will have all three of
these communication channels, almost all projects will have an issue tracker
which is often used for feature requests and questions as well as reporting
issues.

### Issue trackers

GitHub and Bitbucket have their own, but others such as [Bugzilla][bugzilla]
exist.  Make sure to familiarize yourself with how issues are created and what
is supposed to go there.

### Instant messaging

[HipChat][hipchat], [IRC][irc], and other solutions.  The point is that you can
communicate with anyone who is online instantly.

### Mailing lists

Yup, just amazing email.  Whether self hosted or through
[Google Groups][google groups], they are all really the same.  Read up on the
archives to see what is usually done there.

Fixing issues
-------------
As you use the software, you are almost guarenteed to find issues as you use
the code more and more.  Report the bug with a lot of useful information, ask
questions on IRC or mailing lists, get things done.
